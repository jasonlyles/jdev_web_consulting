Maybe, after initial launch:

1. Maybe add bootstraps scrollspy, so I can highlight the active section of the page in the nav up top.

2. I set up email with Zoho, and need to do some documentation.

* For a samples page, I need to do before and after images for GK if I can find it, MS Access Pros
  and BCD. For GK, I might be able to pull down an older version of the code and get it going locally for screenshots.
